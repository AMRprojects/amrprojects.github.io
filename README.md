# Bio  
I am a lead engineer for the United States Department of Defense with 10+ years of experience performing technical and cost evaluations for complex, high-value repair and spare part proposals—ranging from multi-million to billion-dollar programs. My work centers on ensuring the government receives fair and reasonable pricing while maintaining the highest standards of technical rigor and accountability.  
  
I hold a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in control systems and a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, which together provide a strong foundation for the analytical and multidisciplinary nature of my work.  
  
I currently serve within Navy Price Fighters (NPF), a specialized organization recognized across the Federal Government for driving measurable savings through the application of advanced statistical methods, data science, and engineering analysis. Our team’s impact was even highlighted in an official White House [fact sheet][fact_sheet], underscoring the national value of our mission.  
  
My professional interests include control systems, data-driven decision making, and the integration of data engineering/analysis/machine learning with traditional engineering topics.  
  
My competencies include: Excel (advanced), MATLAB (intermediate), Simulink (intermediate), Python (intermediate), C++ (intermediate), MS Access (beginner), MySQL (beginner)
