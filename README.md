# Bio  

I am a Lead Engineer for the United States Department of Defense with over a decade of experience conducting comprehensive technical and cost evaluations for complex, high-value repair and spare part proposals, supporting programs valued from the multi-million to billion-dollar range. My work ensures the government secures fair and reasonable pricing while upholding the highest standards of technical rigor, fiscal accountability, and mission readiness.  

I currently serve within Navy Price Fighters (NPF), a specialized analytical organization under the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) recognized across the Federal Government for its measurable impact in cost savings and acquisition efficiency. At NPF, I lead multi-disciplinary teams of engineers and analysts in developing data-driven cost models, performing detailed evaluations, and supporting contract negotiations for aeronautical and marine weapon systems. Our groupâ€™s contributions were notably highlighted in an official White House [fact sheet][fact_sheet], reflecting the national-level importance of our mission.

My academic background includes a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in control systems and a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, a combination that provides a strong analytical and systems-oriented foundation for my work in cost engineering and technical analysis. I am also Defense Acquisition University (DAU) Business Cost Estimating Advanced (Level III) Certified and maintain an Active Secret Clearance.  

Beyond my core duties, I have led initiatives to modernize internal analytical processes through automation and data integration. For example, I developed Microsoft Access and Excel VBA-based tools to streamline reporting and data visualization, cutting recurring administrative processing time by 75 percent. I also spearheaded the creation of an internal cost-analysis database that consolidated decades of review data, enabling faster and more informed decision-making across the organization.  

My professional interests include control systems, data-driven decision-making, and the integration of data engineering, analysis, and machine learning with traditional engineering disciplines to enhance acquisition and performance outcomes.  


My competencies include:  
Excel (advanced)  
MATLAB (intermediate)  
Simulink (intermediate)  
Python (intermediate)  
C++ (intermediate)  
MS Access (beginner)  
MySQL (beginner)
