**[Greenhouse Controls][Greenhouse_link]**  
+ Recreates non-linear, MIMO (2 Inputs - 2 Outputs - 3 Disturbance Inputs) greenhouse simulation from a published article in MATLAB/SIMULINK
+ Contains two approaches to control simulation:
  1. Classical Control - Linearize non-linear system and design optimal controller using classical control techniques. Analyzes system for additional insights.
  2. Machine Learning - Attempts to control system using Reinforcement Learning. Greenhouse simulation is the "environment", AI agent represents the controller.



  

**[Recommendation System][Rec_link]**  
+ Practice building a recommendation system using pyspark/databricks
+ Currently contains only Collaborative Filter implementation



  
**[EDA/ML Practice][EDA_link]**  
+ Repository containing practice datascience/ML analyses
